**Status**: pre-alpha, *__unplayable__*

# Essence

`game.dev` is a game development simulator. It's:

* text-based
* Web-based
* local-only

## Features

**Focuses on the development**. Economic features are abstracted.

## Roadmap

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for features planned and implemented.

# Reasoning

Few game dev simulators exist. That alone is a crying shame.

Of those, most – if not all – are economic simulators first and development simulators second. They use game dev as an industry to simulate.

They don't simulate the development process well, either. The many forms game development takes – post-release support, overhauls, mods, freeware, DLCs etc. ­– are never portrayed with fidelity, opting instead for a predictable, repetitive process that eliminates the creative for the sake of cash flow.
